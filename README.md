 📋 Project Scope

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepare a customer dataset by handling missing data, outliers, and performing feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain insights into factors affecting customer retention and identify patterns related to churn.
- Predictive Modeling: Build a model (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree) to predict customers at risk of churning, enabling targeted retention strategies.
- Visualization Dashboard: Design a dashboard in Power BI or Tableau to display key insights, including churn risk factors, to support stakeholder decisions.
